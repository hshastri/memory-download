        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <div>
          <h5>My download seems frozen. What should I do? üßä</h5>
          <p>
            If you really thing your download is frozen, restart the download
            with the "Show progress updates" (under advanced settings) enabled.
            This will show you exactly how many files have been downloaded at
            each step.
          </p>

          <h5>Why does it keep saying my input file is expired? üåß</h5>
          <p>
            This happens when ALL of the URL's found in the
            <tt>memories_history.json</tt> file return a bad response from
            Snapchat's servers. The <tt>memories_history.json</tt> file only
            contains valid URL's for approximately 7 days after downloading your
            data from Snapchat. To verify that your download file is still valid
            watch

              >this video</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h5>Why does it say some of my memories failed to download? ü§î</h5>
          <p>
            Something went wrong when trying to fetch some of your files. The
            application attempted to download those memories twice, but failed
            both times. This is likely because something went wrong on
            Snapchat's side. When this happens the application shows you the
            time and type of memory so that you can manually save these files.
          </p>

          <h5>Does the application do anything with my data? üîê</h5>
          <p>
            Your data is only used for requesting your files from Snapchat's
            servers. Your data is used to communicate with Snapchat's servers
            directly and is not used in any other way.
          </p>

          <h5>Can I do this on my phone? üì±</h5>
          <p>No. The application only runs on computers.</p>

          <h5>Which version should I download if I'm using a Chromebook? üíª</h5>
          <p>
            Download the linux version of the application. That is the most
            likely to work on Chrome OS.
